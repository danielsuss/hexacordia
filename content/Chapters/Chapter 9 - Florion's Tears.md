- In a Spiritual plane, far outside our realm of existance, there was once a war. The war between the Everlasting Light, seeking out life, emotion and existance, and the Eternal Shadow, seeking out silence, darkness, and emptiness. The war was fought between these two spiritual entities for an incomprehensible amount of time, before the Everlasting Light finally managed to overcome and seal the Eternal Shadow. However, this caused the Everlasting Light to split into 6 fragments, 6 Brothers. each with a so called God Heart that held a portion of the power of the Everlasting Light. Eventually as these brothers grew, they became bored of the spiritual plane, and decided to create a new realm of existance. They came together with the power of each of their God Hearts, fabricating reality as we see it around us. Cordisalia. It is said they now watch from the cosmos over each of their vast lands, and that they each left a powerful protector in their stead.
- Florion Overseer of the Verdant Continent, his protector Aladaroth the Ancient Sentinal
- Serrok Overseer of the Arid Continent, and his protector Miragor, the Scourge of the Sands
- Illusia, Overseer of The Mirage, and his protector Shambari, the Dream Weaver
- Pyraust, Overseer of the Burning Expanse, and his protector Infernox, the Blaze Sovereign
- Regnaris, the Eldest of the Brothers, Overseer of the Frozen Highlands, and his protector Regnir, the Soldier of the Storm
- and finally Solidon Overseer of the Sunken Abyss, and his protector Ctharun, the Wrath of the Abyss
- He finishes by saying its all folktale, who knows what's real
- after eating their fill, the gang sets off on their journey again, thanking [[Halibon]]

- as they get to the top of the staircase they see four figures, two hooded men and two armoured men, they look like they are having a disagreement
- the armoured men push the hooded figures back causing them to fall over. the hooded men teleport away
- the gang decide to walk down the stairs towards the armoured men
- the armoured men are standing in front of an entrance, the rest of the area they are guarding is surrounded by a tall strong wall made of stone.
- as they approach, they hear one of the armoured men announce "only those with who have been deemed worthy may enter [[Florion's Sanctum]]"
- behind the guards they can see inside the walls what seems to be a dead forest
- the gang asks how they get approval to enter, the guards explain they must achieve the insignia of each of the leaders of the 6 main settlements on the [[Verdant Continent]]
